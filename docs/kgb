1. Disable multiple messages if more than 5 commits are pushed.  Instead announce the last commit with "(+## more commits...)" appended to the note.
2. `project` is the optional project name, defaults to the Repository name.
3. `branch` lets you specify the branch name, or a template with `%s` to fill the branch name in.
4. `long_urls` enables full URLs instead of shortened URLs.
5. `module` sets the module name in the project.
6. `full_commits` enables sending full commit messages to CIA (as opposed to just the first line).
